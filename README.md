### About the Experiment 

Metallography is the study of the microstructure of metals and alloys using microscopy. It is the art and science of preparing, interpreting, and analyzing microstructures in materials to understand materials behavior and performance better. The method is used to evaluate metallic materials in various industries, including the aerospace industry, the automotive industry, and parts of the construction industry. It is also used for process control, including examining defects that appear in finished or partly finished products, as well as the studies of parts that have failed during service. It is an essential branch of the Metallurgical Engineering.
