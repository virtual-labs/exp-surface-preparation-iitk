1. <b>	Sectioning of sample</b><br> Select a representative sample that accurately depicts the material's unique microstructural characteristics. Based on the needs of the analysis, take the sample's dimensions and form into consideration.<br><br>
2. <b>	Sectioning</b><br> Section the sample using a precision cutting machine. The sections ought to be divided perpendicularly to the interest areas. Use a coolant or lubricant when cutting to avoid overheating and sample damage.<br><br>
3. <b>	Mounting</b><br> Insert the divided sample into a mounting substance (often a thermosetting resin) to sustain and uphold the specimen's integrity in the ensuing stages. Make sure you're oriented correctly to get the analysis plane you want.<br><br>
4. <b>	Grinding</b><br> Using abrasive papers or grinding stones, coarsely grind the mounted sample to get rid of extra material and create a smooth, even surface. To improve the surface finish, go to finer abrasive sheets.<br><br>
5. <b>	Polishing</b><br> To achieve a mirror-like surface, polish the sample with polishing papers of varying grit sizes to eliminate scratches and grinding marks. For the last stages of polishing, use a polishing cloth dipped in a polishing suspension (usually alumina or colloidal silica).<br><br>
6. <b>	Electropolishing</b><br> To get rid of any impurities that could impede the electropolishing process, such as grease, oils, or oxides, the workpiece is carefully cleaned. The electrolyte bath is submerged with the cleaned workpiece. The application of a DC current starts the dissolution of the metal surface. An even and smooth surface is the consequence of the removal of metal ions from high points, peaks, and asperities in a preferred location. Any leftover electrolyte solution is rinsed from the workpiece.<br><br>
7. <b>	Etching</b><br> An essential first step in exposing the material's microstructure is etching. Choose the right etchant according to the content being examined. Chemical solutions such as picral and nital are frequently used as etchants. To ensure even and regulated etching, apply the etchant for a predetermined amount of time.<br><br> 
8. <b> Tint etching</b><br> The stock solution is put into a beaker and activated in the prescribed way, or the desired tint etch is mixed using the formula. I usually use 100 to 200 mL of solution in a small glass or polyethylene beaker. Before etching, the correctly prepared sample needs to be thoroughly cleaned because any residue on the surface will prevent the formation of a film. The sample is put on the bottom of the beaker, face up, since many tint etchants require an immersion time of 60 to 90 seconds. After that, slowly twirl the mixture, taking care not to splash any on your hands. Depending on the sample and solution, the surface starts to color in 20 to 40 seconds. The beaker is now kept still until the surface turns from red to violet. After being taken out, the sample is cleaned with warm water, sprayed with ethanol, and dried. Keep your hands off the sample's surface. The sample is held in the solution with tongs and gently agitated until the surface is darkened for tint etchants that work quickly. The macroscopic surface color of these etchants is typically a grey-black hue.<br><br>
9. <b>	Rinsing and drying</b>- To get rid of any last bits of debris or etchant, thoroughly rinse the polished and etched sample with water or an appropriate solvent. Use a gentle, lint-free cloth or a stream of air to dry the specimen.<br><br>
10. <b>  Mount removal</b><br> If required, use a heated mount remover or an appropriate solvent to remove the mounting material.<br><br>
11. <b> 	Final cleaning</b><br> Use a mild detergent or solvent to clean the sample and get rid of any leftover contaminants. Before examining the specimen under a microscope, make sure it is completely dry.<br><br>
12. <b> 	Microscopic examination</b><br> The prepared specimen should be placed on the microscope stage. For a thorough examination of the microstructure, use the proper magnification and lighting. Take pictures or draw sketches for your documentation.<br><br>
13. <b> 	Analysis and reporting</b><br> Conduct any required measurements or analyses in accordance with the study's goals. Note down all the results, including phases, microstructural characteristics, and any anomalies.<br><br>
14. <b> 	Preservation (optional)</b><br> If the specimen needs to be preserved for an extended period, think about applying a protective layer (like lacquer) to stop oxidation.
