Metallography is the study of the microstructure of metals and alloys using microscopy. It is the art and science of preparing, interpreting, and analyzing microstructures in materials to understand materials behavior and performance better. The method is used to evaluate metallic materials in various industries, including the aerospace industry, the automotive industry, and parts of the construction industry. It is also used for process control, including examining defects that appear in finished or partly finished products, as well as the studies of parts that have failed during service. It is an essential branch of the Metallurgical Engineering.<br> 
A well-prepared metallographic specimen is:<br> 
a.	A representative sample<br> 
b.	Sectioned, ground, and polished to minimize disturbed or flowed surface metal caused by mechanical deformation and thus to allow the true microstructure to be revealed by etching.<br> 
c.	Free from polishing scratches and pits and liquid staining<br> 
d.	Flat enough to permit examination by optical microscope or SEM.<br> 
Various steps involved in the specimen preparation and the significance of each step:<br>  
Many steps in the preparation of metallographic specimens described here are also applicable in other types of metallographic studies, such as electron microscopy, micro-hardness testing, quantitative measurement of constituents of structures, and electron microprobe analysis. Preparation of metallographic specimens generally requires five primary operations:<br> 
a.	Sectioning<br> 
b.	Mounting (which is necessary when the sample cannot be held properly due to its shape and/or size while polishing)<br> 
c.	Grinding<br> 
d.	Polishing<br> 
e.	Etching<br> <br>
These operations are listed below in the order they are performed.<br>  
<b> ▪	Sectioning</b><br> 
Separate test pieces or coupons attached to castings or forgings should be designed so that a minimum of sectioning is required for producing metallographic specimens. Sectioning becomes necessary when studying parts that have failed in service, where a specimen must be taken from a large block of material. Therefore, metallographic studies of such samples often involve more than one sectioning operation.<br> 
Many metallographic studies require more than one specimen. For example, a study of deformation in wrought metals usually requires two sections- one perpendicular to, and the other parallel to, the central axis of the direction of deformation. Failed parts may best be studied by selecting a specimen that intersects the origin of the failure if the origin can be identified on the surface. Depending on the type of failure, it may be necessary to take several specimens from the area of failure and adjacent areas.<br><br> 
<b> ▪	Mounting of Specimens </b> <br> 
The primary purpose of mounting is to make it convenient to handle specimens of arbitrary shape and/or small sizes during various steps of metallographic sample preparation and examination. A secondary purpose is to protect and preserve extreme edges or surface defects during metallographic preparation. Specimens may also require mounting to accommodate various types of automatic devices used in metallographic laboratories or to facilitate placement on the microscope stage. An additional benefit of mounting is identifying the sample (name, alloy number, or laboratory code number) without damaging the specimen.<br> <br>
<b> Compression mounting:</b>  It is the most common mounting method, which involves molding around the metallographic specimen by heat and pressure using molding materials such as Bakelite, Diallyl Phthalate resins, and acrylic resins. Bakelite and Diallyl phthalate are thermosetting, and acrylic resins are thermoplastic.<br> 
Not all materials or specimens can be mounted in thermosetting or thermoplastic mounting. The heating cycle may cause changes in the microstructure, or the pressure may cause delicate specimens to collapse or deform. The size of the selected specimen may be too large to be accepted by the available mold sizes. These difficulties are usually overcome by cold mounting.<br> 
Cold Mounting requires no pressure and little heat and is a means of mounting large specimens more rapidly than possible by compression mounting. Epoxy resins are the most widely used cold mounting materials. They are hard and adhere tenaciously to most metallurgical, mineral, and ceramic specimens.<br><br> 
<b> ▪	Grinding</b>  
Grinding is the most important operation in specimen preparation. During grinding, the operator has the opportunity to minimize mechanical surface damage that subsequent polishing operations can remove. Even if sectioning is done carelessly, resulting in a severely damaged surface, the damage can be eliminated by prolonged grinding. However, prolonged grinding should be avoided since it might lead to excess heating or surface damage.<br> <br>
<image src="images/Picture1.png"><br><br>
Grinding is accomplished by abrading the specimen surface through a sequence of operations using progressively finer abrasive grits. Grit sizes ranging from 60 mesh to 150 mesh are usually regarded as coarse abrasives, and grit sizes ranging from 180 mesh to 600 mesh as fine abrasives. Grinding should commence with the coarse grit size for making an initial flat surface and remove the effects of sectioning. Hack-sawed, band-sawed, or rough surfaces usually require abrasive grit sizes in the 80 to 150 mesh range. Grinding should be done sequentially, from the coarser to the finer. A satisfactory grinding sequence might involve 180, 240, 400, and 600 mesh grit sizes. Grinding aims to remove the oxide layer's damaged layer or uneven surfaces that might have formed during the last sectioning operation. However, the depth of cold-worked metal is roughly inversely proportional to the hardness of the specimen and maybe 10 to 50 times the abrasive particle's penetration depth.<br>
To ensure the complete elimination of the previous grinding scratches found by visual inspection, the direction of grinding must be changed by 90o from the one stage of grinding to the next stage. In addition, microscopic examination of the various ground surfaces during the grinding sequence may be worthwhile in evaluating the effect of grinding. Each ground surface should have scratches that are clean-cut and uniform in size, with no evidence of previous grinding scratches. Cleaning before going to the next stage of grinding is always helpful.<br><br>
<b>Grinding Mediums</b><br>
Grinding media are silicon carbide (SiC), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), emery (Al2O3-Fe3O4), and diamond particles. All except diamonds are generally bonded to paper or cloth backing material of various weights in the form of sheets, disks, and belts of various sizes. The abrasives may also be used in powder form by charging the grinding surfaces with loose abrasive particles.<br>
Automatic grinding, as the name implies, is done without hand assistance. All automatic grinding devices use lap surfaces on which paper-based disks are placed or abrasive powder is charged. The lap is either a rotating or a vibrating disk, where the latter is described as vibratory grinding.<br><br>
<b>▪	Polishing</b><br>
Polishing is the final step in producing a flat, scratch-free surface and mirror-like appearance. Such a surface is necessary for subsequent accurate metallographic interpretation, both qualitative and quantitative. The polishing technique should not introduce extraneous structure, such as disturbed metal, pitting, dragging out of inclusions, and staining.<br><br>
<b>Mechanical Polishing</b><br>
Mechanical polishing is frequently used to describe the final polishing procedures involving cloth-covered laps and suitable polishing abrasives, such as Al2O3 slurry. The laps have either a rotating or a vibrating motion, and the specimens are held by hand, held mechanically, or merely confined within the polishing area. Polishing should be done in a relatively dust-free area, preferably removed from the area for sectioning, mounting, and rough grinding. Any contamination of a polishing lap by abrasive particles carried over from preceding operations or by dust, dirt, or other foreign matter in the air cannot be tolerated. Carryover because of improper cleaning between final polishing steps is another prime source of contamination. It is just as crucial for the operator to wash his/her hands meticulously as it is for him/her to remove all traces of polishing abrasive from the specimen before proceeding to the next finer polishing operation.<br><br>
<b>Electrolytic Polishing</b><br>
Even with the most careful mechanical polishing, some disturbed metal, even a very small amount, will remain after the preparation of a metallographic specimen. This is no problem if the specimen is to be etched for structural investigation because etching is usually sufficient to remove the slight layer of disturbed metal. However, electrolytic or chemical polishing is preferred if the specimen is to be examined in the polished condition or if no surface disturbance can be tolerated. The basic principle involved in this technique is anodic dissolution of the sample's surface which results in a leveling and brightening of its surface.<br>
Electro polishing does not disturb any metal on the specimen surface and is ideally suited for the metallographic preparation of soft metals, most single-phase alloys, and alloys that work harden readily. The disadvantages of electro-polishing include preferential attack in multiphase alloys caused by differences in electrical potential between phases. Proper choice of electrolyte and operating conditions will minimize these disadvantages.<br><br>
<b>▪	Etching</b><br>
Metallographic etching is used to reveal the structural characteristics of a metal. This is essential since these structural characteristics are not visible in the polished mirror-like surface of the metal. It can be used for phase identification, dislocation density calculation (etch pitting), and orientation studies. The principle of etching multiphase alloys is based on the preferential attack (different rates of electrochemical dissolution of phases in the etchant) or preferential staining of one or more phases because of differences in chemical composition and grain orientation. Before being etched, a specimen should be inspected for polishing defects, such as scratches, pits, relief polish, comet tails, pulled-out inclusions, and voids.<br><br>
<b>Chemical Etching</b><br>
Chemical etching is accomplished by immersing the specimen in (or swabbing it with) a suitable etchant until the required structure is revealed. Etching is done in Petri dishes or in other suitable containers with loose covers to prevent excessive evaporation of the solvent, particularly alcohol solutions. Glass containers can be used for all etchants except hydrofluoric acid solutions, where the container should be made of polyethylene or other suitable material. Using tongs or other convenient handling devices, the surface of the specimen is immersed in the etchant with some agitation to ensure that fresh etchant is in contact with the specimen all the time. Most metals lose their bright appearance during etching, indicating that etching is taking place. With practice, one can ascertain the completion of etching by the degree of dullness of the surface. If the etching procedure calls for swabbing, the surface of the specimen can be swabbed with cotton saturated with the etchant, or the specimen can be immersed and swabbed while in the solution. When etching is complete, the specimen is rinsed in running water and then in alcohol, followed by drying in a stream of warm air (hand dryer). After etching, the specimen surface is observed under the optical microscope to study its microstructure.  Care should be taken while etching so that the hand is not affected by the etching.
